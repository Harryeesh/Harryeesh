    * Getting hack ta previously viewed web pages is a common yt uneasy ta Re users dae to the large volume of personally accessed information on the web. This paper leverages human's natural recall process of using episodic and man memory cue to acilitate recall, and presents personal web revisitation technique called WebgePre through context and content keywords Underlying techniques for content content memories acquisition, storage, decay, and utilization for page re-fleding are disc made. A relevance feedback mechanism is also involved to tailor to individual's memory strength and revisitation habits Among uer study show that (1) Compared with the existing web revinitation tool Momento, history For Searching method, and Search Engine method, the proposed Wergelder delivers the best te-fieding quality in finding rate 192.107 Ft measure (041) and average rank error (0.3145) (2) Our dynamic management of content and content memories including decay and reinforcement can mimic users retrieval and recall mechanism With relevance feodhack, the finding rute of WehPagePrev increases by 982 average F1-measure increased by 47 0 and average rank error decreases by 19:44% compared to stable memory management strategy. Among time, location and activity context factors in reactivity is the best recall cae, and content content based re-finding delivers the best performance, compared to content based re-finding all content baned re-finding
